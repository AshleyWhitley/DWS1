		<h2> <a id="WisI">What is it?</a> </h2>
	
		<p>A video game is an electronic game that involves human interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device. 
		The word video in video game traditionally referred to a raster display device, but it now implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. 
		The electronic systems used to play video games are known as platforms; examples of these are <strong>personal computers</strong> and <strong>video game consoles</strong>. 
		These platforms range from large mainframe computers to small handheld devices. 
		Specialized video games such as arcade games, while previously common, have gradually declined in use.
		The input device used for games, a game controller, varies across platforms. Common controllers include gamepads, mouses, keyboards, joysticks and the touchscreens of mobile devices. 
		In addition to video and (in most cases) audio feedback, some games include haptic, vibration or force feedback peripherals.
		Video games have become an art form and an industry. The video game industry is of increasing commercial importance, with growth driven particularly by the emerging Asian markets and mobile games. 
		As of 2015, video games generated sales of USD 74 billion annually worldwide, and were the third-largest segment in the U.S. entertainment market, behind broadcast and cable TV.</p>

		<h2> <a id="WdiM">What are the platforms?</a> </h2>
	
		<p>The term "platform" refers to <em>the specific combination of electronic components or computer hardware which, in conjunction with software, allows a video game to operate.</em> 
		The term "system" is also commonly used.
		In common use a "PC game" refers to a form of media that involves a player interacting with a personal computer connected to a video monitor. 
		A "console game" is played on a specialized electronic device that connects to a common television set or composite video monitor. 
		A "handheld" gaming device is a self-contained electronic device that is portable and can be held in a user's hands. 
		"Arcade game" generally refers to a game played on an even more specialized type of electronic device that is typically designed to play only one game and is encased in a special cabinet. 
		These distinctions are not always clear and there may be games that bridge one or more platforms. 
		In addition to personal computers, there are multiple other devices which have the ability to play games but are not dedicated video game machines, such as mobile phones, PDAs and graphing calculators.
		The web browser has also established itself as platform in its own right while providing a cross-platform environment for video games designed to be played on a wide spectrum of hardware from personal computers to smartphones to name a few. 
		This in turn has generated new terms to qualify classes of web browser based games. 
		These games may be identified based on the website that they appear, such as with "Facebook" games. 
		Others are named based on the programming platform used to develop them, such as Java and Flash games.</p>
